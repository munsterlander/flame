# 1. Preparation


## Prior Knowledge Required

If you have not read the [Ember Quest](../platformer/ember_quest.md) tutorial, you will first need
to complete that tutorial or [download](../platformer/step_7.md#congratulations) the final project
code as this tutorial will focus on converting the existing code to use [Tiled] and traditional
levels.  This means that many of the chapters will start with the full code and will not explain the
physics behind certain components.


## Additional Software Required

To complete this tutorial, you will need to download and install [Tiled] before working on the
actual Flutter code.  Additionally, explaining the nuances of [Tiled] are outside the scope of this
tutorial; however, there are numerous videos online as well as the [Tiled
documentation](https://doc.mapeditor.org) is an excellent resource for beginners.  Finally, there is
additional information in the [flame_tiled](../../bridge_packages/flame_tiled/flame_tiled.md) and
[tiled](../../bridge_packages/flame_tiled/tiled.md) section of the Flame docs.
