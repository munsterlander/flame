# Tutorials

The following are tutorials that are maintained with every release of Flame.

- [](bare_flame_game.md) -- this tutorial focuses on setting up your environment for making a new
  Flame game. This "initial state" is assumed as a starting point for all other tutorials.

- [](klondike/klondike.md) -- in this tutorial, we will build the Klondike
  solitaire card game.

- [](ember_quest/ember_quest.md) -- in this tutorial, we will build Ember Quest, a simple
  infinite side-scrolling platformer.

- [](ember_quest_tiled/ember_quest_tiled.md) -- in this tutorial, we will convert Ember Quest to use
  Tiled and the `flame_tiled` package as well as use traditional levels.

- [](space_shooter/space_shooter.md) -- in this tutorial, we will build Space Shooter, a classic
  top-down shooting game.
